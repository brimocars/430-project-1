Work I did:
Work that is left:
Above and beyond plan:

.eslintrc 
from previous assignments

.gitignore
from previous assignments
It tells git what to put and not put in the repo

All the boilerplate stuff in server.js
from previous assignments
It sets up the server

A thing to parse the body of a request

It parses the body of a request and puts it in req.body

dataHandler.js
From previous assignments
It handles requests for index.html and style.css
