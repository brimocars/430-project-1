The dataset I'm using is from https://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/role?current=true&role_type=senator
It has information about current US senators.
Work I did:
Work that is left:
Above and beyond plan:
Borrowed code:
.eslintrc 
from previous assignments
It sets rules for eslint

.gitignore
from previous assignments
It tells git what to put and not put in the repo

All the boilerplate stuff in server.js
from previous assignments
It sets up the server

A thing to parse the body of a request
From the demo in class, but modified slightly to suit the needs of my http-api-assignment-ii
It parses the body of a request and puts it in req.body

dataHandler.js
From previous assignments
It handles requests for index.html and style.css


// questions for travis:
- do we have to use html forms for the client, or can I just use buttons and inputs
- could my above and beyond work be data persistance? either with just using a file or with mongo
